# Basic Network Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains a basic network configuration created using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Overview

This network demonstrates a very simple Local Area Network (LAN) where two laptops are connected and can communicate with each other through a single switch. It showcases fundamental connectivity within a small, isolated network segment.

## Topology

1x Switch (Cisco 3650)
2x Laptops

Both laptops are connected to the switch, allowing them to exchange data.

## Files

'[Home-network.pkt]': The Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the network configuration.

## How to Open

To view this network setup, you will need Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer. Simply download the '.pkt' file and open it with Packet Tracer.

## Further Improvements

Future improvements could include adding more devices or introducing a router for internet access.
